[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/o2iy3b7k9le0ntps?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/SimonCropp/verify-xaml)
[![NuGet Status](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Verify.Xaml.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Verify.Xaml/)

Extends [Verify](https://github.com/SimonCropp/Verify) to allow verification of Xaml UIs.

Support is available via a [Tidelift Subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/nuget-verify.xaml?utm_source=nuget-verify.xaml&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise).

## NuGet package

https://nuget.org/packages/Verify.Xaml/


## Usage

Enable VerifyXaml once at assembly load time:

<!-- snippet: Enable -->
<a id='snippet-enable'/></a>
```cs
VerifyXaml.Enable();
```
<sup><a href='/src/Tests/GlobalSetup.cs#L9-L11' title='File snippet `enable` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-enable' title='Navigate to start of snippet `enable`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

A visual element (Window/Page/Control etc) can then be verified as follows:

<!-- snippet: Window -->
<a id='snippet-window'/></a>
```cs
[StaFact]
public Task WindowUsage()
{
    return Verify(new MyWindow());
}
```
<sup><a href='/src/Tests/TheTests.cs#L14-L20' title='File snippet `window` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-window' title='Navigate to start of snippet `window`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

With the state of the element being rendered as a verified file:

## OS specific rendering

The rendering of XAML elements can very slightly between different OS versions. This can make verification on different machines (eg CI) problematic. There are several approaches to mitigate this:


 * [Forcing elements to use a specific theme](https://arbel.net/2006/11/03/forcing-wpf-to-use-a-specific-windows-theme/)
 * Using a [custom comparer](https://github.com/SimonCropp/Verify/blob/master/docs/comparer.md)
